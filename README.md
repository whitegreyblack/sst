Simple Syntax Tree

A naive implementation of a syntax tree. Still under development

## Features:
  * Interpreter to recognize basic tokens such as words or numbers.

## Wants and TODOs:
  * Ability to add patterns to recognize non numeric or alphabetic tokens (ie '\d+d\d+(+|-\d)' to recognize die roll pattern)
